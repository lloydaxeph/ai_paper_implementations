* [Multi-Head Attention Transformer - Attention Is All You Need](https://github.com/lloydaxeph/multi_head_attention_transformer)
* [Generative Adversarial Network](https://github.com/lloydaxeph/mnist_gan)

### Computer Vision
* [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/lloydaxeph/imagenet_cnn_implementation)
* [Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](https://github.com/lloydaxeph/simple_frcnn_implementation_from_scratch)
